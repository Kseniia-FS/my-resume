        My name is Kseniia. I'm 33. I'm very passinate about nature, travelling
        and coding. I have 1+ year of experience in Software Development, and it
        is easily compensated by great ability in googling and finding the
        correct solution. I have a wonderfull 7 years old son. By the way
        motherhood taught me patience, understanding and the ability to manage
        my time properly, becuase I always was a working mom. I would be glad to
        find job where I can be usefull not only for company but also for
        society on the whole. As Gandhi said:
        <span>"Be the change you want to see in this world!"</span>
